## Summary

#### This project is a simple rock, paper, scissors game that allows a user to play the game with the computer while maintaining a score card. The user can play as many a times they want. I primarily used HTML5's canvas element and javascript Image object to draw an image (live) and to add functionalities. I also used some CSS for basic styling and responsiveness.
